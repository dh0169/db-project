# ðŸŒ´ Oasis: Library Inventory System

## Project Overview

**Oasis** is a 3-tier web application designed for medium to small-sized libraries. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for library patrons to browse and interact with the library's catalog independently, without requiring direct assistance from librarians. The intended use case includes deployment on a kiosk within the library for patrons to access book information, check out, and return books digitally.

### Key Features
- **User Login**: Patrons can log in to their library accounts to access personalized features.
- **Book Search**: Browse available books by title, author, or genre.
- **Book Checkout/Return**: Check out books or return them using the kiosk system.
- **View Checked-Out Books**: Patrons can see a list of their currently checked-out books and due dates.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Dynamic content rendering.
  - **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling.
  - **JavaScript**: Client-side interactions.

- **Backend**:
  - **Java Servlets**: Handle business logic and request/response processing.
  - **Apache Tomcat**: Serves as the application server.

- **Database**:
  - **MySQL**: Stores all system data, including books, users, and transaction records.
  - **JDBC**: Provides a bridge between the application and the database.

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following core tables:

1. **Users**:
   - Fields: `UserID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Password`, `AccountCreatedDate`
   - Description: Stores user account details.

2. **Books**:
   - Fields: `BookID`, `Title`, `Author`, `Genre`, `AvailableCopies`, `TotalCopies`
   - Description: Stores details about books in the library.

3. **Transactions**:
   - Fields: `TransactionID`, `UserID`, `BookID`, `CheckoutDate`, `ReturnDate`
   - Description: Tracks checkout and return history for each user.

### Relationships:
- **Users â†’ Transactions**: One-to-many (a user can have multiple transactions).
- **Books â†’ Transactions**: One-to-many (a book can appear in multiple transactions).
